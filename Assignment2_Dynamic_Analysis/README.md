# Black-Jack-Game
This is a BlackJack game written in Java and leverages Junit for testing. This game was developed using the Agile Process Model, and was created for the Software Quality course.

## Running game
Since this game was created within Java it should be as simple as downloading the repo and opening the project in an Java supported IDE, and running it. However, if the program isnt already set to be run for whatever reason, make sure that the driver or test class is configured to run and everything should work as intended. If the application isnt able to run there has been screenshot included in my report which can be used as reference.
